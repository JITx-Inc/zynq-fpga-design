SYMBOL | TYPE | DESCRIPTION

CK_t_A, CK_c_A, CK_t_B, CK_c_B | Input | Clock: CK_t and CK_c are differential clock inputs. All address, command, and control input signals are sampled on the crossing of the positive edge of CK_t and the negative edge of CK_c. AC timings for CA parameters are referenced to CK. Each channel (A & B) has its own clock pair.

CKE_A CKE_B | Input | Clock Enable: CKE HIGH activates and CKE LOW deactivates the internal clock circuits, input buffers, and output drivers. Power-saving modes are entered and exited via CKE transitions. CKE is part of the command code. Each channel (A & B) has its own CKE signal.

CS_A CS_B | Input | Chip Select: CS is part of the command code. Each channel (A & B) has its own CS signal.

CA[5:0]_A CA[5:0]_B | Input | Command/Address Inputs: CA signals provide the Command and Address inputs according to the Command Truth Table. Each channel (A&B) has its own CA signals.

ODT_CA_A ODT_CA_B | Input | LPDDR4 CA ODT Control: The ODT_CA pin is used in conjunction with the Mode Register to turn on/off the On-Die-Termination for CA pins. LPDDR4X CA ODT Control: The ODT_CA pin is ignored by LPDDR4X devices. CA ODT is fully controlled through MR11 and MR22. The ODT_CA pin shall be connected to either VDD2 or VSS.

DQ[15:0]_A, DQ[15:0]_B | I/O | Data Input/Output: Bi-direction data bus.

DQS[1:0]_t_A, DQS[1:0]_c_A, DQS[1:0]_t_B, DQS[1:0]_c_B | I/O | Data Strobe: DQS_t and DQS_c are bi-directional differential output clock signals used to strobe data during a READ or WRITE. The Data Strobe is generated by the DRAM for a READ and is edge-aligned with Data. The Data Strobe is generated by the Memory Controller for a WRITE and must arrive prior to Data. Each byte of data has a Data Strobe signal pair. Each channel (A & B) has its own DQS strobes.

DMI[1:0]_A, DMI[1:0]_B | I/O | Data Mask Inversion: DMI is a bi-directional signal which is driven HIGH when the data on the data bus is inverted, or driven LOW when the data is in its normal state. Data Inversion can be disabled via a mode register setting. Each byte of data has a DMI signal. Each channel (A & B) has its own DMI signals.

ZQ | Reference | Calibration Reference: Used to calibrate the output drive strength and the termination resistance. There is one ZQ pin per die. The ZQ should be connected to VDDQ through a 240Ω ± 1% resistor. This connection affects the functionality of RZQ. This is further described in the section on MR0 Register Information.

VDDQ, VDD1, VDD2 | Supply | Power Supplies: Isolated on the die for improved noise immunity.

VSS, VSSQ | GND | Ground Reference: Power supply ground reference

RESET_n | Input | RESET: When asserted LOW, the RESET_n signal resets both channels of the die.
