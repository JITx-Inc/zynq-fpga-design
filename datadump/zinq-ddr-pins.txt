## DDR DRAM Pins ##

The DDR I/O pins are located on bank 504 and can have a 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit data path to the DRAMs depending on the device type. Bytes 0 to 1 correspond to 16-bit data, bytes 0 to 3 correspond to 32-bit data, and bytes 0 to 7 correspond to 64-bit data. Byte 8 refers to the ECC bits. The pins are summarized in Table 17-3. See Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Packaging and Pinout User Guide (UG1075) [Ref 7] for pin assignments. The pin swap guidelines are described in Answer Record 67330. See UltraScale Architecture PCB Design User Guide (UG583)[Ref 15] for clamshell functionality.
