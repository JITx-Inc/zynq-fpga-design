\section{Project Goals}

This project aims to create a simple FPGA example design using the JITX circuit board design tool. The primary objectives are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Design a basic Xilinx Zynq board
    \item Implement essential components including Zynq SoC, DDR4 memory, and Flash memory
    \item Integrate a simple ADC input fed from a Coax connector
    \item Establish a foundation for more complex FPGA designs
    \item Demonstrate the capabilities of JITX in FPGA board design
\end{itemize}

The design will focus on core functionality while maintaining simplicity, serving as a starting point for future expansions and modifications.
